# Inventory App
Presley Roldan

## Overview

This project is a simple inventory management web app. It allows users to load, add, and delete items from a DynamoDB database using a serverless AWS backend (API Gateway + Lambda). The interface is styled using custom CSS inspired by the University of San Diegoâ€™s color palette, focusing on clean design and usability.
